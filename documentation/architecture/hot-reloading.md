# Hot reloading

During development, Fa is compiled to JavaScript and run in a Bun environment. Because JavaScript is run by a JIT compiler, this allows very fast hot reloading and instant feedback.

To start the development server, you can use the following command at the root of your project:

```bash
fa develop
```
