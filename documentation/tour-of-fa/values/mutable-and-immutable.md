# Values

In Fa, we talk of "values" instead of "variables".

By default, a value is immutable, unless declared with the `mutable` keyword.

## Mutable values

Mutable values are **variables**, i.e. values that can be reassigned with the `set` keyword.

```ts
mutable myValue = 12

set myValue = 13
```
