In Fa, you can declare a variable or a function with the following keywords:
- `let` to declare a dynamic variable
- `readonly` to declare a variable or a function that can only be read (can be initialized after declared, but must be initialized)
- `const` to declare a variable that is known at compile-time (or a pure function for functions)
- `reactive` to declare a variable that will automatically be updated when one of its dependencies changes
