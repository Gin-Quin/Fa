The decision of composition vs inheritance must be well-thought because it's going to be hard work to change later.

Composition pros:
- type safe
- there is a field to discriminate the kind
- shorter overall syntax

Inheritance advantage:
- fields from different nodes can have the same value

Let's choose composition!
