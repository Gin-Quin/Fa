# Entity-oriented-programming

# I discovered ECS (Entity-Component-System) model not so long ago
# and I see a lot of great things in this model - especially for
# creative programming

# It has the following awesome features :
# - Composition system over inheritance, very much more flexible
# - Dynamic inheritance
# - Offers the capabilities of hot-reloading while programming (even with AOT compilation)

# The ECS is especially suited to games
# But I see links between games and documents and I would like to try merge all this
# into one single language made especially for *creative programming*
