# class - a generic class. Objects are instatiated and referenced by pointers
# structure - as in Swift, a structure is similar to a class but instantiation does not create a pointer
# anonymous structures - are not referenced either
# abstract - Can't be instantiated. Can only be inherited
# unique - a unique is a singleton. Can't be instantiated. Referenced as a pointer? Could be both, right? -> Isn't it very similar to an anonymous structure?
# interface - used to interface a C++ or JS lib to some Fa code
