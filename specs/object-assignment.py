# Object assignemnt is used thanks to the feed operator

objA << objB

# note : this operator may be overloaded with a custom behaviour
# containers like arrays, maps, set, all overload this operator

myObject <<
	x = 32132
	y = 2131

hercule << health, mana from ajax
hercule << { health, mana }

# Old unaccepted Proposal :
# myObject.:
# 	x = 32132
# 	y = 2131
