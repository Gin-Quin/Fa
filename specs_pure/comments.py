Two types of comments:

# Code comments
@ Doc comments

Blocks which follow comments are treated as comments of the same type.

Example :

#	So let me explain life
	Life has started long ago...
	And for now there is still so many people alive!

@description
	Life has started long ago...
	And for now there is still so many people alive!

Note : it only works for comments which start a new line.
