The most complex `Parser` methods are defined here.

They are organized into three categories :

- **tokenize.cpp** : All methods used to tokenize an input string.
- **grow-tree.cpp** : All methods used to create the syntax stree from the tokens.
- **print.cpp** : All methods that print an output to the console (used for development or debugging).
